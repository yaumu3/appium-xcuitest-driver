<h3 id="mobile-selectpickerwheelvalue">mobile: selectPickerWheelValue</h3>
<p>Performs selection of the next or previous picker wheel value. This might
be useful if these values are populated dynamically, so you don't know which
one to select or value selection suing <code>sendKeys</code> API does not work because of an XCTest bug. The method throws an exception if it fails to change the current picker value.</p>

<p>A list of apps, where each item is a map where keys are bundle identifiers and values are maps of platform-specific app properties. Having <code>UIFileSharingEnabled</code> set to <code>true</code> in the app properties map means this app supports files upload and download into its <code>documents</code> container. Read <a href="https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-xctest-file-movement/">Pushing/Pulling files</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-clearapp">mobile: clearApp</h3>
<p>Deletes data files from the data container of an installed app,
so it could start from the clean state next time it is launched.
The destination app will be terminated if it is running when this API is invoked.
Sometimes it might also be necessary to invoke the following APIs
to fully reset the state of an installed app (make sure the app is not running while
calling them):
- <a href="#mobile-clearkeychains">mobile: clearKeychains</a>
- <a href="#mobile-resetpermission">mobile: resetPermission</a></p>
<p>This API might not be 100% reliable for some apps. The only reliable method to fully
reset an existing app that Apple supports is to <a href="#mobile-removeapp">uninstall</a> it and then perform a fresh <a href="#mobile-installapp">install</a> of the same app.</p>
<p>This API only works on simulators. An exception is thrown if executed with real devices.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-startperfrecord">mobile: startPerfRecord</h3>
<p>Starts performance profiling for the device under test.
Relaxing security is mandatory for simulators. It can always work for real devices.
Since XCode 12 the method tries to use <code>xctrace</code> tool to record performance stats.
The <code>instruments</code> developer utility is used as a fallback for this purpose if <code>xctrace</code> is not available. It is possible to record multiple profiles at the same time. Read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Recording,Pausing,andStoppingTraces.html">Instruments User Guide</a> for more details.
If the recording for the given profile is already running then nothing is done.</p>

<h4 id="returned-result_11">Returned Result</h4>
<p>The resulting file in .trace format can be either returned directly as base64-encoded zip archive or uploaded to a remote location (such files could be pretty large), depending on the <code>remotePath</code> argument value. Afterwards it is possible to unarchive and open such file with Xcode Developer Tools.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-installcertificate">mobile: installCertificate</h3>
<p>Installs a custom certificate onto the device. Since Xcode SDK 11.4 Apple has added a dedicated simctl subcommand to quickly handle certificates on Simulator over CLI.
On real devices the certificate could be installed via CLI if <a href="https://github.com/YueChen-C/py-ios-device">py-ios-device</a> tool is available on the server machine.
On simulators before Xcode 11.4 SDK Apple provides no official way to do it via the command line. In such case (and also as a fallback if CLI setup fails) this method tries to wrap the certificate into .mobileconfig format and then deploys the wrapped file to the internal HTTP server, so one can open it via mobile Safari. Then the algorithm goes through the profile installation procedure by clicking the necessary buttons using WebDriverAgent.</p>

apps must be restarted in order to observe their interface using the newly set locale/language.
Be careful while setting the actual arguments since their actual values are not strictly checked.

Arguments define the choosen strategy: either 'name', 'direction', 'predicateString' or
'toVisible' in that order. All strategies are exclusive and only one strategy
can be applied at a single moment of time. Use "mobile: scroll" to emulate precise
scrolling in tables or collection views, where it is already known to which element
the scrolling should be performed. Although, there is one known limitation there: in case
it is necessary to perform too many scroll gestures on parent container to reach the
necessary child element (tens of them) then the method call may fail.
<em>Important</em>: The implemntation of this extension relies on several undocumented XCTest features, which might not always be reliable. Thus it might <em>not</em> always work as expected.</p>

implicitly performed by a vanilla <code>click</code> API if the destination element is out of the current viewport. An exception is thrown if the scrolling action cannot be performed.

<p>The above three extensions are available since the driver version 4.9.0.</p>
<p>You can create a condition on a connected device to test your app under adverse conditions, such as poor network connectivity or thermal constraints.</p>
<p>When you start a device condition, the operating system on the device behaves as if its environment has changed. The device condition remains active until you stop the device condition or disconnect the device. For example, you can start a device condition, run your app, monitor your app’s energy usage, and then stop the condition.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-calibratewebtorealcoordinatestranslation">mobile: calibrateWebToRealCoordinatesTranslation</h3>
<p>Calibrates web to real coordinates translation.
This API can only be called from Safari web context.
It must load a custom page to the browser, and then restore
the original one, so don't call it if you can potentially
lose the current web app state.
The outcome of this API is then used if <code>nativeWebTap</code> capability/setting is enabled.
The returned value could also be used to manually transform web coordinates
to real device ones in client scripts.</p>
<p>It is adviced to call this API at least once before changing the device orientation
or device screen layout as the recetly received value is cached for the session lifetime
and may become obsolete.</p>
<p>It is advised to enable <code>nativeWebTapStrict</code> capability/setting to speed up dynamic coordinates
transformation if you use this extension.</p>
<h4 id="returned-result_35">Returned Result</h4>
<p>An object with three properties used to properly shift Safari web element coordinates into native context:
- <code>offsetX</code>: Webview X offset in real coordinates
- <code>offsetY</code>: Webview Y offset in real coordinates
- <code>pixelRatioX</code>: Webview X pixel ratio
- <code>pixelRatioY</code>: Webview Y pixel ratio</p>
<p>The following formulas are used for coordinates translation:
<code>RealX = offsetX + webviewX * pixelRatioX</code>
<code>RealY = offsetY + webviewY * pixelRatioY</code></p>

<p>App strings map, where keys are resource identifiers.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-hidekeyboard">mobile: hideKeyboard</h3>
<p>Tries to hide the on-screen keyboard. Throws an exception if the keyboard cannot be hidden. On non-tablet devices the keyboard might not have an explicit button to hide it. In such case this API won't work and the only way to close the keyboard would be to simulate the same action an app user would do to close it. For example, swipe from top to bottom or tap the screen somewhere at the area not covered by the keyboard.</p>
